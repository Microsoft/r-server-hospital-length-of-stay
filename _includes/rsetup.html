<p>Debra would work on her own machine, using  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-r/install-r-client-windows">R Client</a> to execute these R scripts. In case you want to run the code from the VM, R Client has already been installed.</p>

<p>Debra uses an IDE to run R. On your VM, R Studio is installed.  R Tools for Visual Studio is also installed, but you will have to either log in or create a new account to use this tool.</p>

<p>OPTIONAL: You can execute the R code on your local computer if you wish, but you must first  <a href="local.html">prepare both the VM and your computer</a>.   Or you can <a href="jupyter.html">view and execute the R code in a Jupyter Notebook on the VM</a>.</p>

<p>Now that Debra’s environment is set up, she  opens her IDE and creates a Project.  To follow along with her, open the <strong>Hospital/R</strong> directory on the VM desktop, (or wherever you put this folder on your local machine).  There you will see three files with the name <code class="highlighter-rouge">Predicting Hospital Length of Stay</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li>If you are using Visual Studio, double click on the “Visual Studio SLN” file.</li>
  <li>If you are using RStudio, double click on the “R Project” file.</li>
</ul>
