        If you have deployed a VM through the  
        <a href="{{ site.aka_url }}">Cortana Intelligence Gallery</a>, all the steps below have already been performed and your database on that machine has all the resulting tables and stored procedures.  Skip to the <a href="CIG_Workflow.html">Typical Workflow</a> for a description of how these files were first created in R by a Data Scientist and then deployed to SQL stored procedures.

If you are configuring your own server, continue with the steps below to run the PowerShell script.

## Setup 
-----------

First, make sure you have set up your SQL Server by  <a href="SetupSQL.html">following these instructions</a>.  Then proceed with the steps below to run the solution template using the automated PowerShell file. 

## Create Data and Train Model
----------------------------

Running this PowerShell script will create the data tables and stored procedures for the the operationalization of this solution, both in R (in the `{{ site.db_name }}_R` database) and Python (in the `{{ site.db_name }}_Py` database).  It will also execute these procedures to create full database with results of the steps  â€“ dataset creation, modeling, and scoring as described  [here](dba.html).


1. Download  <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/r-server-hospital-length-of-stay/master/Resources/ActionScripts/SetupVM.ps1" download>SetupVM.ps1</a> to your computer.

1.  Right click on SetupVM.ps1 and select `Run with PowerShell`.

1.  Answer `Y` if asked if it is ok to execute this script.

1.  When prompted, enter the servername, username, and password for your SQL 2016 or SQL 2017 server.  (The Python version of this solution is only available if you are using a SQL 2017 server.)

    
## Review Data
--------------

Once the PowerShell script has completed successfully, log into the SQL Server Management Studio to view all the datasets that have been created in the `{{ site.db_name }}_R` and `{{ site.db_name }}_Py` databases.  
Hit `Refresh` if necessary.

Right click `Boosted_Prediction` and select `View Top 1000 Rows` to preview the scored regression results.

## Visualizing Results 
---------------------

You've now  created and processed data, created models, and predicted LOS as described  [here](data-scientist.html). This PowerShell script also created the stored procedures that can be used to score new data in the future.  

Let's look at our current results. Proceed to <a href="Visualize_Results.html">Visualizing Results with PowerBI</a>.

## Sample Website for Native Scoring
---------
[This sample website](web-developer.html) shows how you might use the solution to show an estimate of the patient's lenght of stay during the admission process.


## Other Steps
----------------

You've just completed the fully automated solution that simulates the data, trains and scores the models by executing PowerShell scripts.  

See the [Typical Workflow](Typical.html) for a description of how these files were first created in R by a Data Scientist and then incorporated into the SQL stored procedures that you just deployed.
