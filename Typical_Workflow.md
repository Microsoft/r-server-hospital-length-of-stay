This guide assumes you are using an on premises SQL Server for this solution.  

<li>f you have deployed the {{ site.solution_name }} solution from the<a href="{{ site.aka_url }}">Cortana Intelligence Gallery</a> you should instead <a href="CIG_Workflow.html">use this guide</a>.</li>
</div>

To demonstrate a typical workflow, we'll introduce you to a few personas.  You can follow along by performing the same steps for each persona.  

NOTE: If youâ€™re just interested in the outcomes of this process we have also created a fully automated solution that simulates the data, trains and scores the models by executing PowerShell scripts. This is the fastest way to deploy the solution on your machine. See [PowerShell Instructions](Powershell_Instructions.html) for this deployment.

If you want to follow along and have *not* run the PowerShell script, you will need to first create a database table in your SQL Server.  You will then need to replace the connection_string at the top of each R file with your database and login information.

You can perform these steps in your environment by using the instructions in <a href="START_HERE.html">START HERE</a>.

You can find this script in the **SQLR** or **SQLPY** directory, and execute it yourself by following the [PowerShell Instructions](Powershell_Instructions.html).   As noted earlier, this is the fastest way to execute all the code included in this solution.  (This will re-create the same set of tables and models as the above R/Python scripts.)
