<p>Debra would work on her own machine, using  <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/advanced-analytics/python/sql-server-python-services">Machine Learning Services with Python</a> to execute these Python scripts. In case you want to run the code from the VM, ML Services Python has already been installed.</p>

<p>The Python code is present in the <strong>Hospital/Python</strong> directory. </p>

<p>OPTIONAL: You can execute the R code on your local computer if you wish, but you must first  <a href="local.html">prepare both the VM and your computer</a>.   </p>

Follow these instructions to <a href="jupyter.html">view and execute the Python code with the Jupyter Notebook on the VM </a>.

You can also execute the Python code with an IDE.  Both PyCharms and Visual Studio are installed on your VM.  For each, you must first configure the Python interpreter to use `C:\Program Files\Microsoft\ML Server\PYTHON_SERVER\python.exe`.
